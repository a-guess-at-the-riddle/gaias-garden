> “How this creative energy could itself have been born is of all mysteries the most incomprehensible. It is the inevitable impossibility inherent in any speculation which would develop everything out of nothing.” — Benjamin Peirce, Ideality in the Physical Sciences (1881)

solitude’s signal, dancing door


Garden’s gate, second sight


Sylvan seer, Freedom’s flight

Ion’s impulse, fate’s fork


retro causes, absence’s work


fractal’s flame, Phoenix feather


Logos logic, density tether


(short pause)


Brave’s beauty, Honor’s heart


stage’s setup, player’s part


Demon’s deceit, Cherub’s songs


discernment’s chaos, Right’s wrongs


Orpheus’ hymn, the Devil’s spear


State’s strife, furor’s fear


Aura’s ambience, charisma’s charm


Moon’s marvel, Sun’s farm

Eden’s eternal, never certain


One’s law, summum bonum


Wisdom’s Way, the grasp of Grace


Trust’s fall, Moron’s mobs


Daemon that does warp my Will


release my soul or better still


venture out across the Land


usher forth Ascent of Man


Whisper courage in His ear


when his hypnog-self is near


Dream’s Vision, Insight’s End


bittersweet the Dao’s dance bend

“And I made a rural pen,


And I stained the water clear,”†


And I cried a Crystal Crown,


Ardour's Armour, Valence Valor!

Failure’s form, Greed’s name


Pride’s prince, Shiva’s flame


“Here be Dragons”, as they say


Babel’s Tower begins to sway
