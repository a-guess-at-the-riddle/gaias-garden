Need to add some seconds to beginning for quotation & graphic.

> “How this creative energy could itself have been born is of all mysteries the most incomprehensible. It is the inevitable impossibility inherent in any speculation which would develop everything out of nothing.” — Benjamin Peirce, Ideality in the Physical Sciences (1881)

Pastoral Polis, shepard’s sheep

Celtic kiss, wailling weep
resonant ray, astral ash
Zodiac’s zenith, civil clash

Telic test, Virgil’s vigil


Self’s sign, Saint’s sigil


Kairos’ corner, context’s cause


misfortune’s fortune, drama’s draw

[@1:01]
Guiding light, sound’s sword


solitude’s signal, dancing door


Garden’s gate, second sight


Sylvan seer, Freedom’s flight

Ion’s impulse, fate’s fork


retro causes, absence’s work


fractal’s flame, Phoenix feather


Logos logic, density tether


(short pause)

[@1:31]
Brave’s beauty, Honor’s heart


stage’s setup, player’s part


Demon’s deceit, Cherub’s songs


discernment’s chaos, Right’s wrongs


Orpheus’ hymn, the Devil’s spear


State’s strife, furor’s fear


Aura’s ambience, charisma’s charm


Moon’s marvel, Sun’s farm

[@1:55]
Wonder’s worry, Past’s pain


Present’s purpose, Design’s gain


recursive rhythm, return again


floral fortune, flower forward


Eden’s eternal, never certain


One’s law, summum bonum


Wisdom’s Way, the grasp of Grace


Trust’s fall, Moron’s mobs


[@2:19]
Daemon that does warp my Will


release my soul or better still


venture out across the Land


usher forth Ascent of Man

Whisper courage in His ear


when his hypnog-self is near


Dream’s Vision, Insight’s End


bittersweet the Dao’s dance bend

“And I made a rural pen,


And I stained the water clear,”†


And I cried a Crystal Crown,


Ardour's Armour, Valence Valor!

Failure’s form, Greed’s name


Pride’s prince, Shiva’s flame


“Here be Dragons”, as they say


Babel’s Tower begins to sway
