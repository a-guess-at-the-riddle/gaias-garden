## 1. Music

Music track is “Felicity” by Scott Buckley — www.scottbuckley.com.au. See <https://www.scottbuckley.com.au/library/felicity/>

My preferences is for either macrophotography or dynamic (dolly, steadycam, drone) shots.

Need to determine if two shots per line is too fast or not.

## 3. Animation
#### A. Die BlumenUhr, Linnaeus' flower clock (1751)

from <https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/121/1/9/6085529>

Original drawing by Ursula Schleicher-Benz. From Lindauer Bilderbogen no. 5, edited by Friedrich Boer. Jan Thorbecke Verlag. Sigmaringen, West Germany.

An animation of illustration of Linneaus' Flowerclock (or a similar flowerclocks) which transitions clockwise from B&W into color while flowers bloom. Concerning the actual original illustration, the copywrite is difficult to understand. The original source of the image being from what I think is a very old Swedish journal. Here is the citation for which I can't find the text: *Lindauer Bilderbogenno.5, ed. Friedrich Boer (Jan ThorbeckeVerlag)*.

If one want some ideas you can upload the iamge to the generate AI, DALL-E and it will generate some variations. THe flower should bloom starting close the the outside and bloom inward toward the center.

#### B. Orpheus Descending into Hades (15th-16th Cent)

Create a glimmering fire reflection on the medalion.

#### C. Tree icon from M. Pageaeu's *The Languge of Creation* 
animation of flow (thermal?) similar to overhead projector video feedback of pythagorean tree?

## 5. Summary in words.

Side-by-side visual analogies as seen in this World Wildlife Fund Intl. commercial: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG1J9mziges>. Each line of the poem is two alliterative phrases typically consisting of two words each. The two phrases can be the linguistic description associated with the left and right images. The dual shots will cut on the beat with the song consistently. This pattern will be the rhthym until the dramatic climax at (2m 19s) where the pattern switches to a more narrative structure. Here the cuts will increase in double time and the split screen will stop while incorporating an periodic cut bettween the commissioned animation and more shots of video.
