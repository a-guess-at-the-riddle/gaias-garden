## 1. Music

Music track is “Felicity” by Scott Buckley — www.scottbuckley.com.au. See <https://www.scottbuckley.com.au/library/felicity/>

My preferences is for either macrophotography or dynamic (dolly, steadycam, drone) shots.

Need to determine if two shots per line is too fast or not.

## 3. Animation
#### A. Die BlumenUhr, Linnaeus' flower clock (1751)

from <https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/121/1/9/6085529>

Original drawing by Ursula Schleicher-Benz. From Lindauer Bilderbogen no. 5, edited by Friedrich Boer. Jan Thorbecke Verlag. Sigmaringen, West Germany.

An animation of illustration of Linneaus' Flowerclock (or a similar flowerclocks) which transitions clockwise from B&W into color while flowers bloom. Concerning the actual original illustration, the copywrite is difficult to understand. The original source of the image being from what I think is a Swedish journal. Here is the citation: *Lindauer Bilderbogenno.5, ed. Friedrich Boer (Jan ThorbeckeVerlag)*.

If one want some ideas you can upload the iamge to the generate AI, DALL-E and it will generate some variations. THe flower should bloom starting close the the outside and bloom inward toward the center.

#### B. Orpheus Descending into Hades (15th-16th Cent)
